One of the first to see the potential of youth culture and the appeal of celebrity, Terry made his career in chronicling the most iconic faces of the day, including Bridget Bardot, Kate Moss, Frank Sinatra, and Mick Jagger. Terry O’Neill documented the most influential people and moments of the 1960’s by following his intuition, sensing the zeitgeist of the era and its key players before it became known as “the Swinging Sixties,” when its icons were just artists struggling to get a foot in the door. <\/p><p>Terry O’Neill was awarded the Royal Photographic Society Centenary Medal in 2011 and was an Honorary Fellow. He was also awarded a Commander of the British Empire for services to Photography in 2019.

His photographs have transcended him, becoming cultural relics which hold our ideas of celebrity, creativity, and culture as they were perceived in the 1960’s and resonate to this day. <\/p><p>Born in London, as a teenager Terry fell in love with jazz: an affair which was interrupted by the national service. After the war, he was desperate to nurture his love for music in America. Applying for a job as an air steward in the hopes he would land in the United States, he was offered a position as a photographer for the London Airport. Tasked with taking images of the interiors of planes, he soon turned his lens towards the celebrities in the airport who walked the same halls and waited in the same seats as everyone else, and who did not yet have an aversion to paparazzi. <\/p><p>One day, by chance, Terry took an image of Home Secretary Rab Butler and a newspaper asked to buy the image. Terry began working at the Daily Sketch in 1959, marking the beginning of a career in which he photographed celebrities such as Laurence Olivier, Audrey Hepburn, Elton John, Judy Garland, The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Kate Moss, and Faye Dunaway, creating images which became iconic representations of their legacies. <\/p><p>Terry O’Neill very possibly represents the best of the genre: a photographer who loves his life, his work, and his subjects. As one of the first photographers who took the role of a paparazzi, Terry looked to uplift his subjects, capturing their vibrancy, their talent, and their uniqueness, never their worst moments or flaws. In Terry’s world, his celebrities represent the potential of humanity, all its creativity and connection. It is this optimism and hopefulness, this rose-colored view of the world, which has lent staying power to his portfolio of work. In his images, we see icons captured with warmth and softness, images which have the feel of personal photographs taken of friends.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["heading_maNaK3","richtext_XkRARg"],"custom_css":[],"name":"t:sections.rich_text.name","settings":{"color_scheme":"","content_width":"lg","text_alignment":"left"}},"rich_text_Dw7gaM":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"heading_yNKNNF":{"type":"heading","settings":{"text":"Publications","heading_tag":"h3","indent":"none","highlight_effect":"default","highlight_accent_color":"","highlight_text_color":""}},"richtext_MbqX9L":{"type":"richtext","settings":{"text":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elton-John-Terry-Oneill-%20Photographs\/dp\/1788403738\/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1V9ZYUXK3Y6EJ&keywords=Terry+o+neill&qid=1655837913&sprefix=terry+o+neil%2Caps%2C156%20&sr=8-6\" target=\"_blank\">Elton John by Terry O’Neill: 40 Years in Photographs (2022)<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bond-Photographed-ONeill-Definitive-%20Collection\/dp\/1788840720\/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1V9ZYUXK3Y6EJ&keywords=Terry%20o%20neill&qid=1655837913&s%20r=8-3&sprefix=terry%20o%20neil%2Caps%2C156\" target=\"_blank\">Bond: Photographed by Terry O’Neill: The Definitive Collection (2020)<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Terry-ONeills-Rock-Roll-Album\/dp\/1851497722\" target=\"_blank\">Terry O’Neill’s Rock ‘N’ Roll Album (2020)<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/When-Ziggy-Played-%20Marquee-Performance\/dp\/1788840593\/ref=sr_1_10?qid=1655838509&refinements=p_27%3ATerry+O%27Neill&s=books&sr=1-%2010&text=Terry+O%27Neill\" target=\"_blank\">When Ziggy Played the Marquee: David Bowie’s Last Performance as Ziggy Stardust (2019)<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bowie-ONeill-definitive-collection-%20unseen\/dp\/1788401018\/ref=sr_1_7?crid=1V9ZYUXK3Y6EJ&keywords=Terry%20o%20neill&qid=1655837913&sprefix=terry%20o%20neil%2Caps%2C156&sr=%208-7\" target=\"_blank\">Bowie by O’Neill (2019)<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elton-John-ONeill-definitive-%20portrait\/dp\/1788401484\/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1655838509&refinements=p_27%3ATerry+O%27Neill&s=books&sr=1-2&text=Terry+O%27Neill\" target=\"_blank\">Elton John by Terry O’Neill (2019)<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Breaking-Stones-1963-1965-Brink-%20Superstardom\/dp\/1851498168\/ref=sr_1_10?crid=1V9ZYUXK3Y6EJ&keywords=Terry+o+neill&qid=1655837913&sprefix=terry+o+neil%2Caps%2C1%2056&sr=8-10\" target=\"_blank\">Breaking Stones: 1693-1965 (2016)<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Two-Days-that-Rocked-%20World\/dp\/1851498060\/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1655838509&refinements=p_27%3ATerry+O%27Neill&s=books&sr=1-6&text=Terry+O%27Neill\" target=\"_blank\">Two Days that Rocked the World: Elton John Live at Dodger Stadium (2015)<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/All-About-Bond-Terry-%20ONeill\/dp\/1901268578\/ref=sr_1_14?crid=1V9ZYUXK3Y6EJ&keywords=Terry%20o%20neill&qid=1655837913&sprefix=terry%20o%20neil%2Caps%2C156&sr=%208-14\" target=\"_blank\">All About Bond (2012)<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Eltonography-Life-Pictures-Terry-%20ONeill\/dp\/1901268330\/ref=sr_1_9?crid=1V9ZYUXK3Y6EJ&keywords=Terry+o+neill&qid=1655837913&sprefix=terry+o+neil%2Caps%2C156&sr=8-%209\" target=\"_blank\">Eltonography;
